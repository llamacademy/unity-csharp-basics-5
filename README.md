In this tutorial repository (with [associated video](https://youtu.be/1N6k7Hj_JKc)), aimed at absolute beginners who have very little to no coding experience whatsoever, you'll learn about delegates, when to use them, and when you might want to use a UnityEvent instead!


**📝📝📝YOUR HOMEWORK!📝📝📝**

Update your singleton MonoBehaviour to raise events when it spawns an object and when that object is destroyed! For the simplest implementation you can just do a Debug.Log but think about the signature of the event so you can apply it to your game!
